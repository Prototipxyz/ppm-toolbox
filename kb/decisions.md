# DECISIONS

## Architecture
- D-01: Multi-tenant SaaS — one app, one DB, RLS isolation per organization
- D-02: Users are global; role is per organization
- D-03: Org switcher shown only if member belongs to 2+ organizations
- D-04: Org types: company / group / solo / platform
- D-05: Group holding structure via parent_org_id
- D-06: Two-layer roles: functional role (permissions) + display role (free text label)
- D-70: **Terminology: Organizations / Members / Clients** (supersedes earlier "companies/users")
- D-71: App working title: **PPM** (Prototip Project Management). Final name candidate: **ORDO**.
- D-74: Clients tab uses local DB — not Attio (zero tokens, instant, offline)
- D-76: GitHub account: `Prototipxyz`. Vercel active. PPM = new repo separate from prototip.xyz.
- D-77: Stirg management presentation postponed until further notice.

## Data Model
- D-07: Quote-first — folder created at Quote; WO opens on win
- D-08: Quote number = WO number (Q→WO prefix changes, number stays)
- D-16: `display_name` separate from `part_number` for human-readable display
- D-17: display_name rule — capital+digit start: keep underscores; else: underscores→spaces
- D-18: Empty BOM part numbers → auto C570001+ (above highest existing C561562)
- D-19: Photos Option B — per WO BOM line item (not global per PN)
- D-20: Three photo types: Reference (Inventor render), Issue (worker), Completion (optional)
- D-21: Parts hierarchy via parent_id self-ref; assembly_level 0/1/2
- D-22: Status roll-up automatic: assembly blocked if any child blocked
- D-23: BOM import from Inventor structured Excel (Item column = hierarchy)
- D-24: Exchange rate default 117 RSD/EUR, adjustable per transaction
- D-25: Rework tracked via stirg_hours_log.log_type (Standard/Rework/Revision/Recall)
- D-26: Rework always absorbed internally (covered by risk margin)
- D-78: Client numbering scoped per organization (C001 under Stirg ≠ C001 under Prototip)
- D-82: **Part revision letters** = A, B, C. `revision TEXT` field on parts table.
- D-84: **Photo reuse** — `part_reference_photos` table stores canonical photo per org+PN.
- D-86: `work_orders.context` field = **REMOVED.** `organization_id` is source of truth.

## BOM Structure
- D-96: **Three-level BOM maximum** (0=final assembly / 1=sub-assembly / 2=part). Operations are tracked per part/assembly row — no separate PN per operation. Matches Stirg's actual workflow and avoids the complexity of Stadler/SAP-style operation PNs.
- D-97: **Same PN in multiple assemblies** = one parts row per WO instance, quantity summed in queries. Total quantity required = sum across all parent assemblies.
- D-98: **Assembly-level operation assignment**: L0 (final) = paint + final assembly; L1 (sub) = weld + sub-assembly; L2 (part) = laser/bend/cut/procure. CAD Fixed + Drawings Ready apply at all levels.

## Features / UX
- D-28: AI bar persistent above bottom nav — not FAB, not tab
- D-29: Contextual chips change per screen; chip tap pre-fills text
- D-30: Chip actions = zero tokens (direct DB write)
- D-31: Smart chips skip parts already at target status
- D-32: AI restricted to manufacturing operations only (server-side guardrails)
- D-33: Two hour logging modes — factory real-time vs knowledge worker end-of-day
- D-34: Pause types: Break / Material wait / Machine issue / Other job / Other
- D-35: Knowledge worker minimum threshold: >20 min per WO to log
- D-36: Supervisor approval for worker hour logs (end-of-shift)
- D-37: Export reflects active filters
- D-38: All documents bilingual (SR primary, EN secondary)
- D-39: Quote internal costs hidden from client
- D-40: Quoted value fixed at approval; never changes
- D-43: Dark mode primary
- D-44: Stirg accent #E8450A | D-45: Prototip accent #2563EB
- D-46: Monospace for all engineering identifiers
- D-73: Supervisor sees all workers (flat, no team structure) — revisit after trial
- D-75: N/A operations hidden in Parts UI — only relevant operations shown
- D-72: Worker login: PIN code
- D-79: **App branding = company name in header only.** No logo or custom colors in app UI.
- D-80: **UI theming = light/dark toggle only.** Custom logo/fonts/colors for documents only.
- D-81: Workers use **personal phones, stay logged in.** No per-shift PIN re-entry.
- D-83: Google Drive folder creation = **manual** for now.
- D-85: `stirg_operations` = **self-service.** Each org fills in their own rates/norms.

## UX Principles
- D-87: **Role-aware home screen** — Worker sees personal task queue; Supervisor sees live team status board; Manager/PM sees WO job list with health indicators; Owner/CEO sees financial portfolio dashboard.
- D-88: **Progressive disclosure** — all screens start minimal; detail revealed only on tap/expand.
- D-89: **Optimistic UI** — status updates reflect instantly in UI before server confirmation.
- D-90: **Worker AI bar hidden** — Workers do not see the AI bar.
- D-91: **WO detail default tab is role-dependent** — Supervisor → Parts tab; Manager → Overview tab; Owner/CEO → Financials tab.
- D-92: **App language = floor language** — no software jargon. "Job" not "record", "task" not "entry".
- D-93: **Onboarding = first real action** — user completes one real task in first session; that is the tutorial.
- D-94: **Empty states are explicit and actionable** — never blank; always a message and single next action.
- D-95: **Destructive actions require explicit multi-step confirmation** — BOM import must show consequences and require deliberate confirmation.

## Explicitly Excluded
- D-47–D-57: No real-time collab, no MRP, no Gantt, no custom report builder, no email parsing, no bookkeeping, no payroll, no native app, no GPS tracking, no in-app messaging, no BYOK initially

## Toolchain & Build Approach
- D-99: **Build from scratch with Claude Code** — no boilerplate (MakerKit etc.). MakerKit only if auth/multi-tenancy hits a hard wall. Lovable = throwaway UI sketchpad only, never the product.
- D-100: **Claude Code only** — no Cursor. Add Cursor later if needed.
- D-101: **agent-skills via HTTPS first**, seamless transition to SSH once SSH keys configured on laptop. Install: `/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git`
- D-102: **App repo = `ppm-app`, monorepo** — app + supabase migrations + docs in one repo. KB stays in `ppm-toolbox`.
- D-103: **Deployment = `ppm.prototip.xyz` subdomain** via existing Vercel account. Migrate to new domain later.
- D-104: **Sub-folder CLAUDE.md files generated as each module is reached** — not upfront.
- D-105: **All 5 PPM skills written before any coding begins** — `implement-migration`, `implement-rls-policy`, `implement-api-route`, `implement-component`, `kb-patch`.
- D-106: **Feature specs live in `kb/specs/` in ppm-toolbox repo** — tracked, feed CLAUDE.md, visible to developer on handover.
- D-107: **Build sequence = Schema first, then auth** — all migrations + RLS + seeding + TypeScript types before any UI.

## Worker Auth
- D-108: **Worker PIN auth = Option C** — Owner invites worker by email (Supabase Auth). Worker taps link once, session stored on personal phone (stays logged in, D-81). Every subsequent open shows PIN screen. PIN stored as bcrypt hash on `members` table, validated server-side. If phone lost: owner deactivates member, new phone requires one-time email link again. Zero custom auth logic — Supabase handles sessions entirely.

## Development Workflow
- D-109: **Spec-Driven Development** — every feature gets a 10-line spec in `kb/specs/` before Claude Code touches it. Format: what it does, what it doesn't do, acceptance criteria, edge cases.
- D-110: **Reviewer subagent in fresh context** — after every feature build, review runs in a new Claude Code session seeing only the diff. Never the session that built it.
- D-111: **No deadline but no drag** — build in focused sprints, one phase at a time, ship each phase to Vercel when stable. Stirg pilot when Phase 3 (Worker UI + hours logging) is complete.

## Project & Workflow Decisions (from chats)
- D-112: **Product category = lightweight MES with job costing** — closest to Odoo Manufacturing stripped of 80% complexity. One-line: "What you get if Odoo Manufacturing and Jobber had a child, raised on a factory floor in Serbia, with an AI assistant."
- D-113: **Worker UI is the real moat** — no ERP has a good factory-floor UI. PIN login, simplified interface, real-time operation tapping with pause reasons is what manufacturers actually need and currently solve with paper and WhatsApp.
- D-114: **BOM queries use recursive CTEs** — `parent_id` self-reference with `assembly_level` requires PostgreSQL recursive common table expressions for hierarchy traversal. Plan for this in Phase 1 schema.
- D-115: **KB-BUILD.md = condensed project file for new chats** — ~3k token summary of all decisions, entity fields, roles, status values. Full KB stays in GitHub as source of truth. KB-BUILD.md uploaded to Claude.ai project panel, updated after each session.
- D-116: **New chat opener standard format** — start every new project chat with: "PPM build — continue. Read KB-BUILD.md. Last completed: [X]. Next: [Y]."
- D-117: **Session sync rule** — at end of every chat that produced decisions: run kb-patch skill, push to GitHub, regenerate KB-BUILD.md, re-upload to project panel.
- D-118: **BOM display_name rule for compound names** — names with multiple capitalised segments (e.g. "Magna-Lok Rivet") are kept as-is. Only single-word names with underscores get underscore→space treatment. (From BOM analysis chat.)
- D-119: **Generic CAD names flagged for review** — BOM import flags names like "Product1", "Part1", "Assembly" as requiring manual rename before production use. Shown in amber in review UI.
- D-120: **Parts deduplication in flat view** — flat list shows unique PNs with total quantity summed across all parent assemblies. "In assemblies" column shows count in orange when PN appears in multiple places.


## Configurable Operations (D-121 to D-130)
- D-121: Fixed 9-column parts schema replaced with three-tier configurable system:
  Global pool (PPM-managed) → Org catalog (per org) → Part assignment (per part).
  The 9 hardcoded op columns on `parts` table are removed entirely.
- D-122: Pipeline strip maximum = 12 segments. Only assigned non-N/A ops render.
  PM can add/remove ops on a part card up to the 12-segment ceiling.
- D-123: Operation fulfillment flag on every part-level assignment:
  `fulfillment_type: in_house / outsourced / TBD`.
  Outsourced ops automatically generate a procurement item.
- D-124: Global pool operation IDs = `OP-00001` sequential with leading zeros.
  Category stored as separate field, not encoded in ID.
- D-125: Global pool promotion trigger = cross-org only (Option B).
  Same op name (fuzzy matched) in 5+ distinct orgs triggers admin review queue.
  Single-org internal usage never triggers promotion regardless of frequency.
- D-126: Admin review flow — PPM admin panel shows flagged ops.
  Decision: approve into global pool / reject / merge with existing op.
  Approved ops receive permanent OP-NNNNN ID.
- D-127: Add/remove operations on part card = Owner, Manager, Supervisor only.
  Worker cannot add or remove operations.
- D-128: Removing an In Progress operation is hard-blocked.
  Must be reset to Not Started before removal. Warning shown.
- D-129: New op added to a part → saves automatically to org catalog.
  Never goes directly to global pool. Cross-org usage count triggers promotion per D-125.
- D-130: Two industry presets at launch:
  Sheet Metal Fabrication (Stirg profile) + Engineering Services / Prototyping (Prototip profile).
  Each is a curated starter op set. Fully adaptable after activation.
- D-98: ~~Assembly-level operation assignment hardcoded (L0/L1/L2 per op type)~~
  SUPERSEDED by D-121/D-130. Now a soft suggestion (`default_assembly_levels[]`
  on `org_operations`), not a hard rule.

## Warehouse & Location Tracking
- D-131: **Warehouse location tracking = optional org feature.** Enabled per org by Manager. Not required for pilot — post-pilot Phase N+1.
- D-132: **Storage location types: Pallet or Shelf Bin.** Org configures count and type. App generates sequential 3-part location codes: Zone-Row-Position (e.g. A-02-04).
- D-133: **Location codes are short alphanumeric, human-readable.** QR codes generated as printable PDF with configurable label dimensions. Fallback: worker types location ID manually if camera unavailable.
- D-134: **Storage location setup managed by Manager role** (not Owner-only, not Supervisor).
- D-135: **General material inventory excluded from scope.** Raw stock handled by Business Central. Worth revisiting post-pilot as Phase N+2.
- D-136: **Drop-off scan is the primary location commitment.** After completing an operation, worker scans or types destination location + quantity. Skippable with flag — never a blocker.
- D-137: **Tapping Start on an operation clears the previous storage location** — no separate pick-up scan. Start = "I have the parts" + timer begins simultaneously (Model B).
- D-138: **Location skip = warning flag on PN, never a work blocker.** Supervisor resolves manually, or next operator ratifies by confirming where they found parts when tapping Start.
- D-139: **Quantity at location model.** Location record stores "N of M at A-02-04." Start tap decrements or clears. Drop-off sets new quantity and location.
- D-140: **Location persists through N/A operations.** Last known drop-off carries forward silently until the next active operation's Start tap clears it.
- D-141: **Batch scan supported.** Worker selects multiple PNs (same or different WOs) and assigns to one location in single scan. Quantity entered per PN.
- D-142: **Next operator's Start tap ratifies previous skip flag** by prompting "confirm where you found them" — soft prompt, skippable.
- D-143: **Three-tier warehouse model.** Tier 1 = disabled (default, all orgs). Tier 2 = simple/flat named locations (LOC-001), free text names, no enforced structure — for shops where parts go wherever there is space. Tier 3 = structured Zone-Row-Position codes (A-02-04), zones map to permanent physical fixtures not functional areas. Orgs upgrade Tier 2 → Tier 3 without losing data. `organizations.warehouse_tier` field: none/simple/structured.
- D-144: **QR label size defaults: 100×50mm (bin/shelf) and 148×105mm A6 (pallet).** Custom width/height input available. OQ-48 resolved — no need to ask Stirg upfront.

## Phase 1 Build — Session 1 (2026-06-14)
- D-145: **`public.clients` renamed to `public._legacy_clients`** to resolve naming collision. The new `public.clients` table (external parties per D-70/D-78) cannot coexist with the old `clients` table which held org-level entities. Old 2 rows (Stirg Metal, Ivan Advokat) preserved in `_legacy_clients` for migration in migration 6.
- D-146: **Migration history repair** — 8 remote migration versions from legacy ppm setup (20260609192327 through 20260611092839) marked as `reverted` in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`. Schema and data untouched. Required to unblock `supabase db push` in the new ppm-app repo.
- D-147: **Seed migration `20260614000006_seed_orgs_and_members.sql` required before Session 2.** Must run before migrations 6–19 because later tables FK into `organizations`. Must: insert Stirg Metal org (code: STIRG, org_type: company), insert Prototip org (code: PROTO, org_type: solo — new, did not exist), move Ivan Advokat from `_legacy_clients` into `public.clients` under Prototip org (U-04), insert Voja as Owner member for both orgs, fix `organization_branding` rows for both orgs (U-03).
- D-148: **All 5 PPM skills implemented and live as Claude Code project slash commands.** Mechanism: `.claude/commands/*.md` files in ppm-app repo — Claude Code reads these automatically as `/command-name` slash commands. Files also exist in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (agent-skills format, secondary). The `.claude/commands/` path is operative. Skills: `/implement-migration`, `/implement-rls-policy`, `/implement-api-route`, `/implement-component`, `/kb-patch`.
